# tasks 

1	What is the overall average tip?

2	Get a numerical summary for 'tip' - are the median and mean very different? What does this tell you about the field?

3	Prepare a boxplot for 'tip', are there any outliers?
4	Prepare a boxplot for 'total_bill', are there any outliers?
5	Gender: what is the percent of females in the data? 
6	Prepare a bar plot with the bars representing the percentage of records for each gender.
7	Does the average tip differ by gender? Does one gender tip more than the other?
8	Does the average tip differ by the time of day?
9	Does the average tip differ by size (number of people at the table)? 
10	Do smokers tip more than non-smokers?
11	Gender vs. smoker/non-smoker and tip size - create a 2 by 2 and get the average tip size. Which group tips the most?
12	Create a new metric called 'pct_tip' = tip/ total_bill - this would be percent tip give, and should be a better measure of the tipping behaviour.
13	Does pct_tip differ by gender? Does one gender tip more than the other?
14	Does pct_tip differ by size (number of people at the table)? 
15	Make the gender vs. smoker view using pct_tip  - does your inference change?
16	Make a scatter plot of total_bill vs. tip.
17	Make a scatter plot of total_bill vs. pct_tip.
